# Refresh Leaderboard
This Openplanet plugin does the turning "Always display records" off and on again to refresh the leaderboards at the click of a single button, saving you a few clicks to the settings. It is also styled to fit in with the default UI, hides in gamemodes where the leaderboards aren't visible, and hides when the leaderboard has been collapsed.
## Source
Is the leaderboard visible, but the button not? Or did you encounter any bugs or problems? Please report them in the Github repository by creating an issue. You may also post suggestions or feedback there.
